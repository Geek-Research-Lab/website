          <h5 class="white-text">Company History</h5>
          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">An inspiration to start a company since 1999 which appeared as a plan by two kids for building their dream stuffs and make money. They both entered into addictive Internet world on 2006. After gaining good experience in Internet, the siblings finally decided to start something on 2008. Dragon Wolverines (now, known as Geek Research Lab) was started on mid 2008 by a 17-year old teenage girl as founder and co-founded by her 15-year old intelligent brother. Unfortunately, she left the city for 4 years to pursue her engineering and rarely visits home twice in a year. Her brother managed it for a year during his sister's absence. On Late 2009, things got collapsed and fights happened between siblings. Somehow, peace was made. On Early 2012, the Facebook page was launched but it never worked out and it failed. On March 17th 2012, an official domain along with web server and mail server was bought for Dragon Wolverines. On Late June 2012, the siblings broke-up again. Then, the startup was managed by her alone. Earlier, the startup focussed on content management and web development. Later on 2013, the startup was renamed as "Geek Research Lab". The startup extended to IT, Research, innovations and extreme development. Several projects was built independently where some of them were opensourced. On July 2015, a new person joined in. Now, the startup is managed by 2 people.</p>
